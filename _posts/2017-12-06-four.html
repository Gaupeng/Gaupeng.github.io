<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">With less than four days of my study break left, I've started
    questioning the whole point of study breaks. I find them to simply be the parent-friendly term for holidays. I
    personally have almost always studied more on normal working days than during study breaks. You see, the main
    problem is these study breaks aren't just a day or two, they're usually a couple of weeks, and anything more than a
    couple of days gives me a sensation of a mini-vacation. That usually means that I'll be curled up in one corner of
    the house with anything but a textbook.<br /><br />The thing that brought me crashing back to reality was when a
    friend sent me a question in doubt. It took me down a rough guilt trip to think that the very people sitting next to
    me in class are working their behinds off while I master the art of procastrination. And as if the guilt driven by
    the fact that your classmates are studying insanely isn't enough, the question in doubt I receive is on a page of
    questions with almost every question neatly ticked off.<br /><br />I internally groan, try to ignore the tick marks
    that are now popping at my eyes, and prod at the question in doubt. What added to my misery? I couldn't solve it. If
    there's anything that absolutely frustrates me, it's not being able to solve a question that I initially thought I
    could.<br /><br />I sigh and set an alarm to wake up early to study as I hit the bed, my eyes now opened. I calm
    myself down, knowing this isn't the end of the world. There are four more days, what could possibly go wrong
    ðŸ˜‰?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
