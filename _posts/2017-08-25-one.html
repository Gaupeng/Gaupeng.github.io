<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left" trbidi="on">
  I haven't written in a long time.<br /><br />Alright, that is partially
  incorrect. What I'm trying to say is that it's been years since I've visited
  the first blog my dad had created for me, that are now filled with poems made
  by a child who thought poetry was made of sentences that rhymed. The one thing
  that hasn't changed though, is my desire to write. I still feel the same joy I
  did seven years ago, tapping away at the keys on my keyboard. Obviously
  though, writing means much more to me now, than it did earlier, as now writing
  provides me with a sense of comfort that was absent back then. When I used to
  write those "poems", it was all based on a topic given by other people on the
  internet, and although there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, what I wrote
  was always forced, and in a desire to show the world that I could write at
  such a young age.<br /><br />So this is my first attempt to get back into
  writing, by a (slightly more) mature person in me (I hope). As to the question
  of writing on my old blog? I think I'll let that be there as a constant
  reminder of why I started writing (and to all those early mornings and late
  nights of trying to find words that rhyme with each other), and maybe one day
  I'll go back to writing over there, but right now I don't think I'm ready to
  write there.<br /><br />It is extremely hard, being my first post, to show how
  excited I am to get back into writing, and I hope this time, I don't stop.
