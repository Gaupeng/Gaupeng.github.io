<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left" trbidi="on">
  College has introduced me to some truly amazing people. People smarter than I
  could ever imagine being, people more creative than I have ever seen and
  people who are always better than me at something or the other.<br />
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    Back in school, at some point I completely loved myself for who I was
    because I knew I would be someone others would be looking up to. But
    college? College introduced me to thousands of other people who were much
    better than I am in all aspects. Academically, appearance-wise (haha, what
    appearance?), and socially.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    The first two don't affect me as much as the last one has been doing
    recently. I look at people who easily go up to others and have amazing
    conversations, conversations that I look back upon and wonder why I couldn't
    be a part of. People so confident in what they say, to a point where I envy
    them.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    I have never been very great at expressing myself while speaking, and though
    it never affected me as a person, looking at others do it flawlessly, makes
    me wonder why in the world I can't be more like them. Maybe I was always
    like this, but college has made me realise one of my biggest flaws is not
    being able to hold conversations with people. I am utterly terrible at
    taking the first step at starting a conversation, and even when someone else
    does that for me, half the time I have no idea what to say.&nbsp;
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    There are times when I think of saying something to someone, but when I
    approach them, I am not able to put my thoughts into words the way I want
    to. This laughable fear of not being socially accepted has suddenly risen
    from nowhere, and keeps bobbing up to the surface every now and then.&nbsp;
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    I know this is an absolutely silly fear, and maybe, one day, far from now
    I'll look back at this post and have a good laugh at how stupid this is.
  </div>
