<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I never understood the concept of designing one's surroundings
    unless to make it look pretty, until I joined the hostel. You see, in the hostel, a bright white tubelight in your
    third of the room, with two other tubelights lighting up an exceptionally crammed room which has barely any space to
    walk, never created a mood to study, until I walked into a friend's room, and saw one thing that I knew could create
    the mood I was looking for - a table lamp using an incandescent bulb. &nbsp;Design isn't about making objects look
    prettier. Well it is, but it also is about creating an atmosphere that a person would have pleasure working
    in.<br />
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>Come to think of it, even though I barely understand these modern concepts of abstract art in paintings and
        design, I now can appreciate it for the comfort it provides just being there. I think these small things, like
        paintings on your wall and your favorite color curtains hanging in front of the windows, are the things that
        create a homely feeling in our homes. Barren walls with just furniture sitting around, could never give the same
        homely feeling as flowers in a vase on the bookshelf, or a bright orange wall, partially covered with paintings
        would.&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>Clearly though, my hostel has no intention of giving me that sensation of home, with a bed that doesn't fit my
        fairly long legs, and walls covered in the markings of previous students.</div>
    <div>
        <div><br /></div>
        <div>It is at times hard to get the inspiration to do an unexciting task such as studying, and to think a table
            lamp created the mood for me to study, and make me write this, I feel - is pretty impressive.<br /><br />
