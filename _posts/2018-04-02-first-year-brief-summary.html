<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left" trbidi="on">
  With just under a couple of months left for me to get through my first year of
  engineering, I thought it would be a great idea to sum up how the experience
  has been so far.
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    What's important to note is, I'm writing this, completely aware that I have
    an assignment submission due tomorrow. An assignment I was supposed to
    complete over the four day weekend that just flew by. The two days following
    tomorrow are filled with class tests that could affect my grades, and from
    next week I have my internals.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    (If I was ever asked to describe a day in college in one paragraph, it would
    be the above paragraph.)
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    But college hasn't been just about meeting deadlines at the line. Looking
    back at the eight months of my engineering so far, time seems to have zipped
    by.&nbsp;
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    I remember joining college, a nervous and socially awkward person, not
    knowing what to expect from what would be a remarkable experience. The first
    week was probably the hardest. Finding your group among a swarm of people
    isn't easy. Making your home in those people is even harder. It takes time
    for everything to piece together, but when it does, everything just seems to
    click.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    I met a whole new bunch of people, with whom I'd go on to create terrific
    memories, crack stupid jokes, and spend most of my time with. People without
    whom attending classes would be way more dreadful than it is now.&nbsp;
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    <div>
      Academically, college is slightly on the easier side (if you don't go in
      with high expectations). Topics are more understandable and there's less
      to memorise. Formulae finally have sensible proofs. Labs are survivable
      with the right company. Most importantly, you're finally allowed to use a
      calculator.&nbsp;
    </div>
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    College is basically academics and friends. The former being impossible to
    get through without the latter. It's been an amazing experience so far, and
    I'm certainly looking forward to the next three years, and hoping they're as
    fun as these first eight months have been.
