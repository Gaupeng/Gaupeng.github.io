    Earlier today, on a video call with my sister who has a four-year headstart on life, she joked about how I have "old
    man" habits. I turn only 24 soon, and yet I love long walks, I often spend a lot of time admiring sunsets and I have
    a social battery that does not support fast charging.

    I am easily delighted by pink patches in the sky, amused by calls with my favorite bully - my sister, and more
    recently, I have started finding joy in journaling (infrequently) my days. It is very likely that a few years
    younger Gaurang would have agreed with my sister in saying that these are old-people habits, but somehow I have
    found these activities to be refreshingly cathartic.

    There's a bit of a joke in the WhatsApp status of a long-time friend - "Change is the only constant", it states.
    He's had the same status since early 2018.
</p>

    My understanding of this possibly very deep statement has changed with time. While accepting the change, I have also
    started appreciating the constants. The sunset skies that always promise a show, family and friends that have stuck
    around forever, and writing, all contribute to it. I think "What are your constants?" could work as a slightly
    deeper icebreaker than "What are your hobbies?".
</p>

    This year has been filled with a lot of change both voluntary and unforeseen, and it's perhaps likely that as a
    young adult, this will continue, so it's quite nice to sometimes depend on the constant for small wins.
</p>
<p>
    So, what are your constants?
